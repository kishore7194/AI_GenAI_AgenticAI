========10th Aug 2025 (AI, Generative AI, Agentic AI, FSDS ==========

java developer - if you learn java 
.net developer - if you learn .net 

if you learn ai, gen ai, agentic ai -- multiple job role you can apply 
generative ai vs agentic ai 
-- to build one app ( how much time required ) 

generative ai -- generate the code ( user need to copy the code and paste in vs code ) so
that the app will display 
agentic ai -- user assigne the task to agenet 
		task - build app caluclautor 
		agent - hit to llm ( qwen) -- 
			agent write the code 
			agent will create frontend 
			agent build the app
company -- developer write same code ( 3 days )
		that's company are doing lay off
	automation -- this called automation 
AGENTIC AI -- 

Microsoft office -- build 
		excel | word | ppt 

right tiem right tech -- good in growth
we build ai + azur cloud ( azur ai )
AI MODEL == PYTHON PROGRAM
AI MODEL + AZUR = AZUR AI 
AZUR -- MICROSOFT 
AI MODEL + AWS == AI IN AWS AI 
GCP AI ( WORKSHOP)

top 5 programing langu in the world -- python will come between 1-5

1- google 
2- google colab (google software now) 
3- clicked 1st link
4- new notebook (notebook developer will write the code) 
5- cell will open 
6- start code 

===
1st code -- Number
1, 2, 3 

statistical term number is called  == NUMERICAL DATA 
statistical term text is called == CATEGORICAL DATA 
when you listen to me first ( slow in typeing better you work later)
6-7month ( 4-5yr) experience professional -- 
1st code -- working with number in python 

code , notes, document must be neet & cleand

4- new folder -- new repositrory
5- give name of repository ( ai _genai_agentic_ai
6- drag entire folder and move to gitaccount
7- https://github.com/kodigitaccount ( update this link in your resume) 
8- everyday every (notes, code, pdf make sure you will save in your desktop & github)
9- google classroom
10- after enrolled this batch i will give you classroom access 
11- i will create whatapp group
12- easy , medium , hard
13 - if few concept are not understan no need to panic ( recording)
14- 6month 
15- technical jargon 

sometime if we upload code in our personal desktop (data is loss)
upload you practise code -- post in repositry 

qusterion and answer

===== 28th

if any learners unablto install the software please do it in weekend 

we will start python programing language 
this language is one of the top 5 langauge in the world from last 7yr onwards 
dominant for next 10yr for sure. 
Python for ai, gen ai, llm , agentic ai, data science. 

AGENDA -->
--
python introduction 
steps to downloads classnotes from google classroom
python variable introduce 
1hr + 2hr on daily basis 
all real time problem solve by object . 
memory - object we will be create in ram 
father -- Guido van Rosam

python name comes from -- complete monty python flying circus

library == framework == package

matplotlib -- librar only take care of visualization 
pandas -- datbase -- collection of table ( rows * coloumn) 
deep learning =- tensorflow, keras , pytorch
dynamin - system is automaticall understaing code meaning
 platform independend 
 same code can be written in window, mac, linux 

 Anaconda python(Bigdata,datascience) 
 
=== python introducetion 
who is father of python 
python version, platform independent, 
dynamic programing language 
object oriented programing language 
python is popular == ml, ai, gen ai, llm, prompt, agentic ai, cloud 
python version 

=== IDE ( integrated development environemnt)
user or developer canwrite code, run the code, debug the code 
	error -- Bug | fix the error - debugging 

Jupyter ide | vs code ide  | pycharm ide | spyder ide ( 4 IDE)
google colab (IDE) 
These ide can also installed in organization (company) 

==All my learners to install 5 ides 

=== interpreter vs compiler 
interpreter = excecute the code line by line or section of code 
compiler = entire code run at once 
python is both programing language ( interpreter + compiler ) 
== python introduction is completed 
== code 

1- Python Variable 
a = 5 

5 is value which has name called a 

syntax of the -->
	variable = value 

who ever instlled please open jupyter notebook 
who every doesnto install please opne google colab 

every program has some reserved word or keyword 
if you complete all the python keyword then python is completed 
 python we have some reserve word 
 
 

---
RULES TO DEFINE PYTHON VARIABLE -->
---
1- Variable cannot start with digit but end with digit 
2- Variable are case sensive ( if you define the variable lower case ) you must be call with lower case only 
3- Keywords == Reserved words are not define as Variable 
4- No special characate will be define as Variable
5- Only _ is allowed 

python variable are completed 

variable == identifier == object 
a = 5 a is called as (variable = identifier = object)

- Every day please post your github account 




['False', | 'None', |  'True',] 
 'and',
 'as',
 'assert',
 'async',
 'await',

 'not',
 'or',
 'pass',
 'raise',
 'return',
 'try',
 'while',
 'with',
 'yield']
 
==== 29th

variable name = value 

value also called as datatypes 

i = 5
f = 5.6
s = 'a3max'
b = True 

by listening the regular class you wont be datascience or ai engineer
you have put effort atlease 2hr daily basis 
variable name = value 

function -- alwasy ends with () 
===
family(d, m)  -- argument or parameter 
	family() with 2 argument or 2 parameter 
	
fam2 ( d, m, s, k) 
	fam2() with 4 argument 

german(bmw, audi, mer, fear) 

argument == parameter 

=== python datatypes 

int = value with out decimal is called integer ( done) 
float = value with decimal (done)
		only e letter is allowed in float 

Complex == 1 + 2j 

1 - real part 
2 - imaginary part 
j - squre root of -1 

len() -- it give us the count 
type() - it give us data type 
print() - it print the statemnt or print the output 
argument or parameter

complex & bool is completed 

int -- value without decimal 
float - value with decimal 
bool - True & False ( True - 1 & False - 0) 
complex - 1 + 2j 
string -- python number & text 

Text techncical name is called as string 
	
string must be declare with 
'' | " " | ''' '''

' ' | "" -- worked for single line comment 
''' ''' -- we will be using for multiline comment 


today we are complete python data types

=== 1st Sep

working professional -- job, family, learn this course ( maintain 3 thing)
		upto how do you handle this 
		even you though you dont have time just view the task , project 
		
Non technial, fresher -- i would happy you to help if they have any querry 
		6-8hr on daily basis 
----		
python Type casting -->
---
int --> from all other datatype to int | float, comp, bool, string -- int 
	while casting float to int -- valid ( user shold not decalare 2 argument together)
	complex & text string -- is not valid other datatypes to int is possible 
		
float
complex
bool
string 

		

- from other all other datatypes to int & float type casting is possible except 
			complex & text string, user should not pass more then 1 argument 
			
- from all other datatype to bool is possible 
- from all other datatype to string is possible 
- from all other datatype to complex

=== python variable, datatype, type casting 
=== give you task (work or not work it is )

=== INDEXING =====

python indexing begins with 0 

We will apply in the string
id() 
len() 
print()
type() 

new topic started old topic forget 
	just talk to the brain (sigma rule) 

=== 
python index divide into 3part
1- forward index
2- backward index
3- step index 

=== 2nd 

slicing (: )

1:5 --> print the value from 1st index to 5-1 indexing 
:5 --> print the values from 1st to 5-1 index 
5: --> print the value from 5th index to last 
0:10:3 --> print the value from 0 to 10-1 every 3 step count 

once string is define we cannot update the string -- this concept in python is called as immutable 

==== print() 

every day i will explain new topics
forget old topics -- 


10 yr sde, 
ds, da, ba, pe, -- new world less code 

i dont you to be an expert at coding 
40% code 
java -- 100% coding (which is too tough) 
python -- 80% coode
datascence, dataaalyust -- 40% code 

	chatgpt -- text 
	insta - comments
	youtube - comment 
	
text - string 
print() in depth 

llm - large language model 
print format -- .format is mendatory along {} 
if you are create variable -- that means {} 
--- end statement -->

=== 3rd 

ARITHMETIC OPERATOR  == (+ - * ** % / // )
UNARY  (-)
ASSGINMENT - +(= -=, *=, /=, //=) 
RELATIONAL < > >= <= == != 
LOGICAL - and, or , not

TRUTH TABLE -->

AND ( 1 & 1 = 1 | rest of them are 0) 
OR (0 OR 0 = 0 | rest of them are 1) 

=== NUMBER SYSTEM CONVERSSION ( 4 part) 

1- Binary (base value 0 & 1)---  (0b )
2- Octal (base 8 | 0-7 )  -- (0o)
3- Decimal (base 10) 0-9 -- (0x)
4- Hexa decimal (base 16) 0-9, a-10, b-11, c-12, d-13, e-14, f-15 | ( 0x)

=== 
do not try to complete the work in the classhour 
please attention 
====
Non coding background --

1st time - see the code write 
2nd time - dont see the code and write ( 1day)
3rd time - after 1month same code please write it again( slowly you will gain momentum)
